Demonstrates my ability to do Systems Analysis & Design and
Includes Systems Design Doc and Business Requirements Doc.

DriverPass project summary is a system requested by DriverPass client that sees only 35%
of students passing the drivers exam and wishes to help solve this problem with an easily
accessible app and website that guarantees better rates of success with driving students
regarding exams.

I analyzed an interview transcript thoroughly and wrote a business requirements document.
If I could revise one part of these documents, it would be professionalism - in which I use
humor creatively in a rebellious manner in the use case diagram in the system design document.

I interpretted the user needs in my system design poorly, as I did not consider the user needs
while writing the system design. Instead, I was focused on an objective of emulating existing
driving website functionality - albeit in a humorous way. I did not take the assignment seriously
as there were no actual customers to consider. If there were customers however, then it would be
extremely important to consider user needs because it is the users that the product is being made
for. Without people to use the company's product, it would be a waste of valuable resources to develop.
For instance, in October I work at a haunted house as an ordinary employee and I see lots of flaws that
anger and turn away customers, who will likely post bad things about said place on social media.

In the past I'd skip design and simply develop software such as a text-based video game after watching
YouTube game development tutorials and solving any problems intuitively. However, I noticed that as a project
grows in scope, it becomes disorganized and difficult to manage - similar to how a skyscraper would fall over
very quickly if it didn't have a solid foundation. In the future, techniques and strategies all
depend on the type of job I'm assigned. If I'm a programmer then it depends on things like whether it's
Waterfall or Agile methodology that the company is using. For instance, the Agile methodology is very adaptive
and does not rely on extensive documentation whereas in Waterfall, documentation means everything.
